Quick Start
===========

Silk is installed like any other Django app.

First install via pip:

.. code-block:: bash

	pip install django-silk

Add the following to your ``settings.py``:

.. code-block:: python
	
	MIDDLEWARE = [
	    ...
	    'silk.middleware.SilkyMiddleware',
	    ...
	]

	INSTALLED_APPS = [
	    ...
	    'silk.apps.SilkAppConfig'
	]

Add the following to your ``urls.py``:

.. code-block:: python
	
	urlpatterns += [path('silk', include('silk.urls', namespace='silk'))]

Run ``migrate`` to create Silk's database tables:

.. code-block:: bash

    python manage.py migrate

And voila! Silk will begin intercepting requests and queries which you can inspect by visiting ``/silk/``
